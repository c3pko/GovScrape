This project was built off of a Scrapy Django example scraper for WikiNews
It is intended to scrape govtrack, archives.gov, any site that has legislative requirements for the OSTP + Executive Orders
You may find it easier to scrape this project and just use a python one-off-command, you'll just need to
load the python command into a template in order to view it which can be tricky
